"I want to create a professional and visually appealing website for my fitness coaching business. The goal is to establish an online presence that highlights my services, builds trust with potential clients, and drives engagement. Since my final content isn't ready yet, the website should be designed with easily replaceable placeholders for text, images, and media. The structure should follow the provided outline, with a clean and responsive layout suitable for mobile and desktop users. Ensure that all sections are visually balanced, intuitive to navigate, and optimized for user experience. Include standard features like call-to-action buttons, a contact form, and social media links. Focus on creating a foundation that can be customized quickly as I finalize my content."
